# Project Mitte: Color Vision Assistance Software

Welcome to the Mitte project repository! This is a project developed as part of a thesis with the aim of providing assistance and support to people who experience color vision deficiencies. Color vision deficiency, commonly known as color blindness, is a visual condition that affects color perception, making it difficult to distinguish between certain hues. Our goal with the Mitte project is to address the needs of individuals with color vision deficiencies, providing a more enriching and inclusive visual experience.

## Current Status

At the moment, the project is in its early stages of development. We have implemented a basic image processing functionality in Python that assists individuals with color vision deficiencies by enhancing color differentiation. While this initial functionality shows promise, we acknowledge that there is still a long way to go to achieve our ultimate goals.


## Current Goals

- **Color Correction:** Mitte offers the ability to adjust color display according to user preferences, enhancing differentiation between tones that would typically be confused.

- **Specialized Viewing Modes:** The software features specific viewing modes for different types of color vision deficiencies, allowing for a personalized and tailored experience to individual needs.

- **Smart Filters:** Mitte's intelligent filters can be applied in real time to enhance colors and details, aiding in the identification of important information within images and interfaces.

- **Application Support:** Seamless integration with various applications and operating systems ensures that Mitte can be utilized in a wide range of scenarios.

## How to Contribute

If you're interested in contributing to the development of the Mitte project, we would be thrilled to receive your contributions! Feel free to explore the code, open issues to report bugs or propose new features, and if possible, submit pull requests.

We appreciate your interest in making the digital world more accessible to individuals with color vision deficiencies through the Mitte project. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of these individuals by providing a more vibrant and inclusive visual experience.
